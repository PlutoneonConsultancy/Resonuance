				<!-- Research and important notes
				The Earth’s principal resonance is the Schumann fundamental ~7.83 Hz and its harmonics; important biological bands include brainwave ranges (delta–gamma), infrasound below ~20 Hz that can affect mood, 40 Hz gamma linked to cognitive/brain‑health effects, and audible musical pitches (e.g., A=432 Hz is a debated “healing” tuning).
				
				Octave‑grouped important frequencies (Hz) — brief notes
				Schumann resonance series ~7.83, 14.3, 20.8, 27.3, 33.8 Hz — Global electromagnetic resonances in the Earth–ionosphere cavity; the fundamental (~7.83 Hz) and its harmonics form a background ELF field that has been studied for links to global lightning activity and possible coupling to biological rhythms.
				
				Delta 0.5–4 Hz (brainwaves) — Deep sleep, tissue repair, very slow restorative states; these are non‑audible electrical rhythms of the brain associated with deep restorative sleep and healing processes.
				
				Theta 4–8 Hz (brainwaves) — Drowsiness, deep meditation, memory consolidation and creative insight; often targeted in relaxation and meditative practices.
				
				Alpha 8–12 Hz (brainwaves) — Calm wakeful relaxation, reduced stress and improved mood; many relaxation/meditation protocols aim to increase alpha power.
				
				Beta 12–30 Hz (brainwaves) — Active thinking, focus, alertness; higher beta relates to anxiety when excessive.
				
				Gamma ~30–100 Hz (notably 40 Hz) — High‑frequency synchrony tied to attention, memory and consciousness; 40 Hz sensory entrainment has shown promising effects on brain‑health markers in animal and early human studies (Alzheimer’s research).
				
				Infrasound <20 Hz — Sub‑audible pressure waves; exposures (especially uncontrolled or persistent) can cause annoyance, unease, and physiological stress responses in some studies, while stronger effects depend on level and duration.
				
				Audible musical pitches (e.g., 432 Hz vs 440 Hz) — Standard concert pitch is A=440 Hz; some practitioners prefer A≈432 Hz and claim subjective calming/healing effects, but scientific support is limited and debated.
				
				How these line up by octave and why that matters
				Octave relationships are multiplicative (×2): e.g., an alpha band center near 8–12 Hz sits roughly one octave above theta and one below low beta; Schumann 7.83 Hz sits in the theta/alpha border, so it overlaps biologically relevant brain rhythms and is often cited in discussions of Earth–brain coupling.
				
				Practical note: exact octave coincidences are approximate because biological bands are broad and Schumann harmonics are not perfect powers of two; nevertheless, harmonic proximity can enable resonance/entrainment effects in nervous systems and ecosystems.
				
				Risks, limits, and evidence caveats
				Important: claims that single frequencies (e.g., 528 Hz or 432 Hz) magically heal are largely anecdotal; controlled evidence is limited. Infrasound can be annoying or stress‑inducing at some levels; 40 Hz entrainment is an active research area with promising but still developing clinical evidence.
				
				Beneficial sympathetic resonances include key brainwave bands (delta–gamma), the Schumann resonance and its harmonics, targeted 40 Hz gamma stimulation, and a set of widely used sound‑healing tones (Solfeggio / tuned musical pitches); each can entrain biological systems or support mood, sleep, cognition, or relaxation when used safely.
				
				Guide to choosing what matters
				
				Decide your goal: sleep/repair, relaxation/mood, focus/cognition, or clinical brain‑health.
				
				Measure risk: intensity, exposure time, and context matter; some claims (e.g., single “magic” Hz heals DNA) lack robust evidence.
				
				Start low and short: gentle entrainment (binaural beats, ambient tones) is safer than high‑level infrasound or loud stimulation.
				
				Beneficial sympathetic resonances (grouped and explained)
				
				Brainwave bands — Delta (0.5–4 Hz), Theta (4–8 Hz), Alpha (8–12 Hz), Beta (12–30 Hz), Gamma (30–100 Hz) — These are endogenous electrical rhythms the brain uses for sleep, memory consolidation, relaxed wakefulness, active thinking, and high‑level binding respectively; many entrainment techniques aim to enhance the appropriate band for a given goal.
				
				40 Hz gamma stimulation — External sensory stimulation at ~40 Hz (light, sound, tactile) can entrain gamma rhythms and has shown promising effects on attention, memory, and markers of brain health in preclinical and early human studies.
				
				Schumann resonance ~7.83 Hz and harmonics (≈14.3, 20.8, 27.3, 33.8 Hz) — Natural ELF electromagnetic resonances of the Earth–ionosphere cavity; the fundamental sits near human theta/alpha bands and is often discussed as a background field that can interact with biological rhythms.
				
				Alpha‑range entrainment (~8–12 Hz) for relaxation and mood — Increasing alpha power (via sound, light, or neurofeedback) is associated with reduced stress and improved calm alertness; many relaxation protocols target this band.
				
				Solfeggio and musical pitches (e.g., 432 Hz, 528 Hz and related tones) — Traditional/modern sound‑healing systems assign therapeutic meanings to specific audible frequencies; empirical support is mixed and mostly anecdotal, though many people report subjective relaxation and mood benefits.
				
				Binaural and isochronic entrainment protocols — Using slight frequency differences between ears or pulsed tones can nudge brainwave activity toward desired bands (sleep, meditation, focus); effectiveness depends on protocol, duration, and individual variability.
				
				Risks, limits, and evidence caveats
				
				Evidence varies: strong mechanistic and preclinical support exists for some approaches (e.g., 40 Hz research), while many popular “healing Hz” claims lack rigorous clinical proof.
				
				Safety: avoid high‑intensity infrasound or loud sound exposure; people with epilepsy or implanted devices should consult clinicians before rhythmic light/sound stimulation.
				
				Commonly cited audible “divine” or Solfeggio frequencies are 174, 285, 396, 417, 432, 444, 528, 639, 741, 852, and 963 Hz; practitioners combine them into chords (triads or full sets) for relaxation, emotional release, and perceived healing. These are traditional/modern healing claims rather than universally proven medical facts.
				
				Guide: how I chose these and what to consider
				Key considerations: purpose (sleep, mood, meditation, ritual), delivery (pure sine, tuned instruments, binaural/isochronic), volume and exposure time, and personal sensitivity. Evidence caveat: historical origins and therapeutic claims vary; some sources trace the Solfeggio set to modern rediscovery and contemporary practice rather than continuous ancient provenance.
				
				Audible “divine chord” frequencies (each item is a commonly used tone and its typical claim)
				174 Hz — Often described as a grounding, pain‑reducing tone used in sound‑therapy playlists; included in extended Solfeggio sets.
				
				285 Hz — Claimed to influence tissue and energy field repair in some sound‑healing systems; appears in expanded Solfeggio lists.
				
				396 Hz — Associated with liberating guilt and fear; one of the original six Solfeggio tones used in modern chant‑based healing practices.
				
				417 Hz — Linked to facilitating change and clearing negative influences; part of the core Solfeggio set.
				
				432 Hz — A concert‑pitch alternative (A=432 Hz) favored by some for its perceived warmth and “natural” tuning; not part of the original Solfeggio but widely used in healing music discussions.
				
				[444 Hz] (often 440–444 context) — Sometimes used as an alternative tuning (A≈444) claimed to produce brighter, uplifting timbres in chordal combinations.
				
				528 Hz — Frequently called the “miracle” or “love” frequency and promoted for DNA repair and transformation in popular sound‑healing literature.
				
				639 Hz — Associated with relationship harmonization and communication in Solfeggio frameworks.
				
				741 Hz — Claimed to aid problem solving and expression; used in cleansing/awakening contexts.
				
				852 Hz — Linked to spiritual order and returning to spiritual balance.
				
				963 Hz — Often labeled the “higher octave” or connection to unity/consciousness in expanded lists.
				
				Each of the above appears in modern Solfeggio and sound‑healing resources; lists and interpretations vary between authors and traditions.
				
				Risks, limits, and practical notes
				Important: these frequencies are primarily used in complementary sound practices; robust clinical evidence is limited and historical claims are contested. Avoid excessive volume; people with epilepsy or implanted medical devices should consult a clinician before rhythmic light/sound protocolsMindVibrations.com.
